##  React’s tic-tac-toe tutorial personal resoution
A Tic Tac Toe game created following the React tutorial, with some personal changes.<br>
Tutorial: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe. 

## Improvements made to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
<ul>
<li>[X] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.<br></li>
<li>[X] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.<br></li>
<li>[X] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.<br></li>
<li>[X] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).<br></li>
<li>[X] Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.<br></li>
</ul>
